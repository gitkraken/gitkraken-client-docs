Sometimes you commit to one branch, when you meant to commit to another. Here's how to grab the changes you need.

***
To cherry pick a commit, right click on a commit node and select the Cherrypick Commit option:

The cherry pick action is also available from _Local_ on the left panel.

Here, cherry pick grabs the changes from the commit referenced by the HEAD of that branch, and places them onto the branch currently checked out.
