Note that required fields are denoted by `*`. Your new issue will automatically sync with your GitLab issues.

### Create Filters

You may create filters to view the issues you need. We use the same syntax that GitLab uses for thier issues.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/new-gitlab-filter.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/new-gitlab-filter@2x.png" class="img-bordered img-responsive center">

You can refer to [GitLab issue filtering](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/search/index.html#filtering-issue-and-merge-request-lists) docs from GitLab for more information.

### Create Branches from Issue

You may create a branches tied to an issue from the issue details view <button class='button button--success button--ui button--nolink'>Create a branch for this issue</button> button. You can also right-click the issue or click the <kbd> <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-v"></i> </kbd>.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/create-branch-gitlab-issue.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/create-branch-gitlab-issue@2x.png" class="img-bordered img-responsive center">

The branch name will automatically prefill based on the issue name. After the branch is created, these branches will be denoted with the GitLab icon to reflect its link to a GitLab issue.

From here, it should be possible to configure triggers on the GitLab side for changes made to this branch.

You can quickly navigate to the issue in GitLab from the <kbd> <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-v"></i> </kbd> menu or by clicking <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i> in the top right.
