## Organization

This section will actually be labeled with your organization name rather than "Organization".  It shows the members and teams within your organization. Click `switch organization` to swap to another organization.

The Owner and any Admins are able to:

- Change role of members within the organization
- Invite members to the organization and purchase licenses
- Create and manage teams


<div class='callout callout--warning'>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> the Organization section is only availibe to users who have a Pro or Enterprise license.

</div>

## General

### Auto-Fetch

Set the number of minutes between auto-fetches. This value must be between 0 and 60 minutes, and it will fetch all visible remotes for the repository. Setting the value to 0 minutes will disable auto-fetch.

If youâ€™re experiencing issues with performance, consider setting your auto-fetch value to 0 and restarting the application. 
 
### Auto-Prune

Removes any remote-tracking references that no longer exist on the remote.

### Default Branch Name

Set the default name when initializing a new repo. The app defaults to `main`.

### External Merge Tool

This is where you may set your preferred external merge tool. 

- [Supported Merge Tools](/working-with-repositories/branching-and-merging/#external-merge-tools)
 
### External Diff Tool

There is where you may set your preferred external diff tool.

- [Supported Diff Tools](/working-with-commits/diff/#external-diff-tools)

### External Editor

You may open a repo in your preferred external editor program using the [Command Palette](/start-here/command-palette/). Supported editors include:

- VS Code
- Atom
- Sublime
- IntelliJ


### Delete ".orig" files

GitKraken Client will make .orig files during a merge. If turned off, these before and after files will not be automatically deleted. 

### Default Terminal

You may open the current repo folder in terminal by navigating to  <kbd><strong>File > Open Terminal</strong></kbd> or use the keyboard shortcuts <kbd><strong>opt</strong></kbd> + <kbd><strong>T</strong></kbd> (Mac) / <kbd><strong>alt</strong></kbd> + <kbd><strong>T</strong></kbd> (Windows + Linux). 

Set your preferred terminal from this preference option for this action.
 
### Use Custom Terminal Command

Enables the option to specify a custom command to open a terminal window. 

For example, to set up GitKraken Client to open Powershell 7, use the command `start "" "C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7\pwsh.exe" -noexit -command "cd %d"`

### Show All Commits in Graph

Enabling this option will force GitKraken Client to always show all commits in repo. This setting may cause performance issues with large repositories.

### Max Commits in Graph

Set the max number of commits GitKraken Client will show in the graph. Lower counts may help improve performance, and the minimum value is 500 commits.

### Remember tabs

This will remember open tabs when you quit GitKraken Client. This option will also remember what tabs you have open for each profile. 

### Longpaths (Windows Only)

For Windows users, GitKraken Client will respect the `core.longpaths` setting in the global .gitconfig. Adjusting this setting will change `core.longpaths` in your .gitconfig. `core.longpaths` only applies to the files in the working directory, not in the .git directory, to maintain compatibility with Git for Windows.

### AutoCRLF (Windows Only)

For Windows users, GitKraken Client will respect the `core.autocrlf` setting in the global .gitconfig. Adjusting this setting will change `core.autocrlf` in your .gitconfig. Enabling this option auto-converts CRLF line endings into LF when adding a file to index, and vice versa when checking out code onto your file system. For more information check out this [git documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration#_core_autocrlf)

### Use extended logging in activity log

Provides more information for the activity log. You may access the activity log from <kbd><strong>Help > Support Logs > Activity Logs</strong></kbd>.

### Forget all Usernames and Passwords

Removes credentials that currently stored by GitKraken Client.

### Share work-in-progress status with my team

Allows other users in your team to see your local work in progress files. This is directly related to the [Teams](/working-with-repositories/teams) feature.
