Additionally, you have the option to Snooze PRs either indefinitely or for a specific duration by clicking the <i class="fa-solid fa-snooze"></i> icon, which will relocate them to the 'Snoozed' section. To retrieve these PRs, simply visit the 'Snoozed' section and remove them from the snooze state."
