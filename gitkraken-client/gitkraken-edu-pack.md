GitKraken Pro is available for free to students through the GitHub Student Pack. If you don't have the pack yet, first apply through GitHub:

[Get the GitHub Student Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)

## Enabling Pro for Students

Once GitHub has approved your pack, you must sign into your GitKraken account through GitHub <strong>1 more time</strong> to enable Pro.

To sign in again, launch GitKraken Client and navigate to <kbd>File    <i class='fa fa-caret-right'></i>     Sign into a Different Account <i class='fa fa-caret-right'></i>  Sign in with GitHub</kbd>

Or you may login by navigating to <kbd><strong>the profile dropdown</strong></kbd> > <kbd><strong>Sign into a different account</strong></kbd> > <kbd><strong>Sign in with GitHub</strong></kbd>

When you sign in with GitHub, GitKraken Client will check whether your GitHub account has the GitHub Student Pack. If the app sees the pack, you should see the `Pro` flag in the bottom right of the UI and you will be able to open private repos.

If you don't see `Pro` then this means GitKraken does not see a pack with the email address tied to your GitHub account. This may mean you need to update the primary email address for your GitHub.com account.
