### Team Overview 

Your teams have a new hub with the Team Overview in Workspaces. 

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/8-9-team-overview.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

This new broad view shows all Pull Requests and all Issues for the repos in your Workspace ‚Äì giving you a high level view of your team‚Äôs coding efforts. 

#### Team Pull Requests

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/8-9-filter-by-author-assignee.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

If your Workspace repos are hosted on GitHub, you may filter the Team Pull Requests by assignee or author.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/8-9-team-pull-requests-columns.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

The Team Pull Requests sections has the following columns:

- Last Updated 
- PR title with link to open the Pull Request in the hosting provider
- PR Author
- Repo name with link to open the repo in GitKraken Client
- Review status
- PR status - Shows status for ‚ÄúDraft‚Äù or ‚ÄúAt Risk‚Äù Pull Requests
- Checks - Shows CI/CD results
- Lines added/removed
- PR branch - Double click to check out directly in GitKraken Client
- Shortcut to open the Pull Request Panel - GitHub Repos only

#### Team Issues

Team Issues will show all GitHub Issues, GitLab Issues, Jira Cloud Issues, Jira Server, or Trello cards associated with the repo. 

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/8-9-team-issues-switch.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

With Team Issues, it‚Äôs easy to switch between Jira or Trello and back to either GitHub Issues or GitLab Issues. If you select Jira or Trello, you can also filter by project so that you only see issues that matter to you.


The Team Overview is in Preview, and feedback is welcome. A link to submit feedback can be found at the top of the view.

### Workspace UI updates 

GitKraken Client v8.9 also updates the UI for the Repositories and Pull Request sections in Workspaces ‚Äì providing clearer information at a glance through updated color coding and iconography.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/8-9-GK-Release-8-9.gif" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

#### Overview > My Issues > Set Issue Tracker

You may now switch the Issue Tracker provider from the My Issues section in the Overview tab. 

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/8-9-my-issues-switch.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

### Left panel improvement
 
In the left panel, you may now expand or collapse sections when filtering the left panel.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/8-9-left-panel.gif" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

We plan to continue pushing more left panel improvements in future releases. Thanks for your feedback so far!

### Single Sign On

#### What is Single Sign On (SSO)?

Let‚Äôs first review the Wikipedia definition of SSO:

_‚ÄúSingle sign-on is an authentication scheme that allows a user to log in with a single ID to any of several related, yet independent, software systems.‚Äù_

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/SSO-setup.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

The above diagram depicts what a typical SSO setup entails. These are the applications or actors involved in the setup:

<strong>Directory Server</strong>:  A Directory Server is an application that stores information about the ‚Äúobjects‚Äù that belong to an organization. An object can be: printers, computers, shared folders, users, groups (a group is just a group of users). Some objects can contain other objects, which then allows them to reflect hierarchical structures.  

- Examples of Directory Server applications are:
    - Microsoft Active Directory
    - Oracle Identity Governance (OIG) Suite
    - Jump Cloud

<strong>Identity Provider</strong>:  An identity provider (abbreviated IdP or IDP) is a system entity that creates, maintains, and manages identity information for principals and also provides authentication services to relying applications within a federation or distributed network. An IdP provider stores 3 main components: Users, Groups, and Applications.

- Examples of Identity Provider applications are:
    - Okta
    - Azure Active Directory
    - Google Identity Platform

The Identity Providers provide services that allow third party applications to authenticate their users. 
The authentication mechanism they provide is called ‚ÄúOauth‚Äù, which allows third party applications to authenticate users without accessing/storing their password. 

#### Requirements and configuration

GitKraken may now initiate an Oauth authentication flow with the following supported Identity Providers (IdPs)

- Azure Active Directory
- Okta
- Google Identity Platform

Please note that your IdP will first need to be configured before setting up the connection in GitKraken. For assistance, please contact your IdP administrator or consult the IdP documentation for help. 

<div class='callout callout--basic'>
    <p>
        <strong>Additional requirements:</strong>
            SSO is only configurable by the GitKraken Owner or Admin and you must be subscribed to either the <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/git-client/pricing">Teams or Enterprise</a> plan.
    </p>
</div>


Ready to get started? Then follow the [How to set up SSO in GitKraken](https://help.gitkraken.com/gitkraken-client/single-sign-on/) documentation.

#### Signing in with SSO

GitKraken Client users should see a new option to Sign in with SSO from the login screen.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/sign-in-with-SSO.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

After clicking <kbd>Sign in with SSO</kbd>, the SSO form will open and ask for an email address to use for SSO login. GitKraken will then check the email and determine whether the email address belongs to a single IdP for SSO. When the email address is successfully identified, the user will be taken to that IdP to login.

If the email is not recognized, GitKraken will display a message that no IdP was found.

Once authenticated, the user may use GitKraken Client.

### Workspace Updates: Overview

Workspaces now have a personalized <kbd>Overview</kbd> section üéâ

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/overview.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

This will provide you with a summary of all Pull Requests, Issues, and WIPs relevant to you for the repos grouped in your Workspace. 

- <kbd>My Pull Requests</kbd>: shows all PRs opened by you, assigned to you, or awaiting your review
- <kbd>My Issues</kbd>: shows all issues created by you, assigned to you, or that mention you.
- <kbd>Work in Progress</kbd>: shows all branches with uncommitted changes


We‚Äôre excited to centralize key information that is relevant to the user. Now instead of hunting for these pieces of information separately, you can get a holistic view of what you‚Äôre working on.

This <kbd>Overview</kbd> section is in `Preview`mode, and we‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts and feedback. Just click on the `Provide feedback on this view` prompt in the upper left of the Overview page to tell us what you think. 

### Partial Stash Support

Sometimes you only need to stash some of the files in your WIP.  

Partial stashing is now available through the Commit Panel. Right-click individual files, or multiple files, and select the <kbd>Stash file</kbd> option to stash those selected files and have their changes reset.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/partial-stash-multiple-files.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

#### Apply changes from stash to working directory

With partial stash, you may now partially apply a stash. When a stash is selected, right click files in the right panel to apply their changes to the working directory.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/apply-stash-multiple-files.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

#### Partial stash tips

- You may name a partial stash by typing into the `//WIP` or summary section before creating the stash.
- Select additional files for stashing or applying by holding down the <kbd>Shift</kbd> or <kbd>Control</kbd> key.
- Applying a file from a stash does not remove the file from the stash ‚Äì use this to safely explore!

### Left panel improvements

Users may now resize sections inside of the left panel. Simply drag the edge of the panes to expand or contract a pane.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/resize-left-panel.gif" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

Additionally, the left panel section headers will now remain visible as you resize the window or left panel panes. 

Don‚Äôt forget! In the previous release, we also made it possible to toggle left panel panes on or off. Use this to customize the view to fit your needs and tastes. 

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/left-panel-toggle-sections.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

### New Tab view updates

Many thanks to our users for submitting feedback! With this release, we‚Äôve moved the `Favorites` and `Recent Repos` list towards the top of the <kbd>New Tab</kbd> view.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/new-tab-view-updates.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

This should make it easier to access the repos you access regularly. 

### More autosuggest in GitKraken CLI

The <code>git remote prune</code> and <code>git remote update</code> commands will now suggest remotes in the GitKraken CLI.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/git-remote-prune.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

Hopefully this saves you extra typing or the need to remember that remote name.

</div>

GitKraken Client v8.7 has been released! Whether you're covering a tear, or just adding some flair ‚Äì we‚Äôve got you patched.

### New + Improved ‚ú® 

_We hemmed in some new threads._

- GitKraken Client now supports the ability to create and apply patches.
    - [Create patch from commit(s)](/gitkraken-client/current/#create-patch-from-commits)
    - [Create patch from uncommitted file(s)](/gitkraken-client/current/#create-patch-from-files)

    - Users will see faster performance when cloning LFS repositories with submodules
    - Users will note much faster performance for general GitKraken Client actions, e.g. reset, merge 
 

### Bug Fixes üêõ
_We‚Äôve stitched up a few loose ends._

- Fixed issue related to GitKraken CLI's autocomplete in Git Bash.
- In Workspaces, users will be notified if attempting to open a deleted or unreachable repo from the repo details section.
- Fixed task lists for GitLab issues showing `&nbsp`.
- Commit graph will immediately update when the app performs a fetch or force push from the terminal.

- Changing accounts will now properly reset the selected Workspace.
- In the Workspace Pull Request section, removing a filter and quickly selecting a PR will no longer generate a blank screen.

### Patch Support

A patch, or patchfile, is a file describing changes between 2 files. Patch files can be used to distribute changes that a given user would like to make to a particular revision without codifying it onto a git server. 

Patch files are especially useful in distributing changes to/from environments where SCM may not be available and remain widespread in older development flows.

With this update, users gain another way to share and save changes.

#### Create patch from commit(s)

Right-click on a commit in the graph to access the new option for creating a patch. 

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/create-patch-from-commit.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

Click the <kbd>Create patch from commit</kbd> option and the app will prompt you to select the save location for the <code>.patch</code> file.

You may also use the <kbd>Shift</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key to multi-select commits and then right click on the selection to access the same patch option. 

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/create-patch-from-multiple-commits.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

#### Create patch from file(s)

From the commit panel, right-click on a file to access the <kbd>Create patch from file changes</kbd> option.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/create-patch-from-file.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

Like the option above, this will prompt you to select the save location for the patch file.

You may also use the <kbd>Shift</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key to multi-select files and then right click on the selection to access the patch option. 

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/create-patch-from-multiple-files.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

#### Create patch from Command Palette

Click on the Command Palette icon on the toolbar, or use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>Cmd</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> to launch Command Palette.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/create-patch-from-command-palette.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

Here, you may search ‚Äúpatch‚Äù to access the <kbd>Create patch from working directory changes</kbd> option and get prompted to select a save location.

#### Apply patch from Command Palette

Use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>Cmd</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> or click the wand icon in the top right of the UI to bring up the Command Palette. Type ‚ÄúApply patch‚Äù to summon the <kbd>Apply patch</kbd> command, and select it to open your file explorer. 

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/apply-patch.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

Select your <code>.patch</code> file to then apply changes to your working directory. From here, you may continue to modify files, move to stage and commit, or continue with your workflow. 

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/after-apply-patch.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">



<div class='callout callout--basic'>
    <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong>
            GitKraken Client does not yet support generating patches from binary files. This is a preliminary release with better support coming, and if you have feedback please <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/git-client/contact-support">contact us</a>.
    </p>
</div>

### Left panel improvements: toggle sections

The left panel can get crowded, so we want to be able to let users disable sections that are not relevant to them.

Now when  you right click headers on the left panel, a context menu appears to remove or add sections.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/left-panel-toggle-sections.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

### Updated UI and layout for New Tab view

The New Tab view has been reorganized! There are now distinct sections for Repositories, Workspaces, Integrations, and Other app actions. 

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/new-tab-view.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

Be sure to try out the integrations!

### Repo aliases in Terminal Tab titles

In our previous v8.6 release, the app provided the option to set an alias for a repository by right-clicking on the repo tab. With v8.7, the alias name will carry over when you open the repo in a Terminal Tab. 

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/alias-terminal-tab.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

### Fuzzy search in `gk history` and `gk blame` commands 

From the GitKraken CLI, you may now use the fuzzy search to drill down on a file name when using the  `gk history` and `gk blame` commands.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gk-history-fuzzy-search.gif" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

Just start typing the name of the file to filter the list of matching files, and then hit enter to select the file for the command. 

### Users may now search tabs by repo alias in the tabs list

In the toolbar, users may click this arrow icon next to the notifications icon to expand a list of all currently open tabs. With v8.7, you may now search using repo alias to filter the list further, and quickly jump to that tab.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/search-by-alias.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">


### Name branch when creating branch from issue

When viewing an issue from inside GitKraken Client, there is now a short text field for naming the branch when creating a branch from the issue.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/name-branch-from-issue.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

Consider setting up [Issue Tracker Integrations](l/gitkraken-client/jira/) like Jira, Trello, GitHub Issues, or GitLab Issues to get access to this handy feature.

### Git LFS performance improvements

On top of performance improvements from the previous release, GitKraken Client v8.7 brings even more boosts. Users will see faster performance when cloning LFS repositories with submodules and note much faster performance for general GitKraken Client actions. 

Here are some actions that should see improvements:

- Cloning a repo with LFS submodule
- Merge
- Reset hard
- Undo a hard reset
- Discard all changes
- Discard unstaged changes
- Discard submodule changes

        - Setting an alias to a Terminal Tab results in only renaming that specific tab. 
- Users can now set GitKraken Client to skip submodule updates while performing Git actions, either globally or per repo.

### Improvements üôå

_Faster for LFS, big repos, and beyond._

- Git LFS performance improvements: 
    - Users will see faster performance when cloning LFS repositories.
    - Users will note much faster checkout times in LFS repositories.		
- Sections in the left panel will now be collapsed by default.
- Users can now set the maximum number of commits shown in the Commit Graph as low as  500 commits.
    - To set the shown commit limit, navigate to <kbd>Preferences</kbd> ‚Üí <kbd>General</kbd> and look for <kbd>Max Commits in Graph</kbd> towards the bottom of that menu.
- Users will note improved performance when the open repo has a large number of stashes.
- When creating a pull request from a branch that starts with an issue ID (e.g, GK-123-feature-branch), a link to the associated issue will now be added to the pull request description automatically.

### Bug Fixes üêõ

_You are a sad, strange little bug, and you don't have my pity._

- When creating a new branch from an issue, users will see the input box as expected.
- When working with remote branches in the left panel, the context menu will remain available.
- GitLab avatars will now more consistently display correctly.
- Branches will immediately refresh when a checkout is performed in a Terminal Tab.
- Users connected to an Azure DevOps integration using Azure's older hostname style (eg. {organization}.visualstudio.com) will now be able to use Workspaces and the Pull Requests section in the left panel.
-  Users leveraging Azure DevOps Workspaces will no longer see a misleading ‚ÄòAdd a Repository‚Äô button in their Workspace. Users will need to visit Azure DevOps directly to add repositories to their Workspaces.

</div>

_The GitKraken team is proud to announce these improvements to Workspaces, Teams, and the GitKraken CLI. Lower your blast shield, trust your feelings, and prepare for the release of GitKraken Client v8.5._


### New ‚ú®

_Git is what gives a dev their power...It binds the galaxy together._

- GitKraken WorkSpaces now support Azure DevOps repositories.
    - Any Workspace created for Azure DevOps will automatically include repos for a selected Azure Project.
    - Workspaces can currently support up to 100 repositories for an Azure Project.
- Visual interactive rebase can now be initiated from the GitKraken CLI, which you can access from a Terminal Tab or a Repo Tab by clicking the <kbd>Terminal</kbd> icon in the top toolbar.
    - Users can type either `gk rebase -i` or `gk rebase --interactive` along with two refs to open the interactive rebase view. If only one ref is passed it will perform the rebase of the branch currently checked out onto the specified ref.

### Improvements üôå

_An elegant Git client for a more civilized age._

- Git LFS Improvements:
    - Users will experience a reduced delay in updating the graph and commit detail panel when selecting commits in LFS enabled repos.
    - Note: Significant work towards reducing checkout times for LFS repos is underway and we plan to include these improvements in the GitKraken Client v8.6.0 release, scheduled for June.
- When creating a new Team, members can now be added as part of the creation process.
- Team members are now sorted by username in the Teams section, found in the left panel of GitKraken Client.
- Improvements to GitKraken Workspaces: 
    - Workspaces can now be shared as Team Workspaces, allowing users to share the Workspace with specific teams within their Organization.  
	- In the Workspaces Repository view, clicking on the name of a repository will open it in a Repo Tab. 
        - Users can view repository information by clicking on the Open Repository Details option, found on the right side of the Repositories view.  
    - Organization admins and owners will see a new "Show All Workspaces" checkbox, allowing a simplified way to see all available Workspaces.  
    - Users can now leverage [GitHub‚Äôs search syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests) when using the Workspaces Pull Requests view search.
    - Users will find more options for filtering in the Workspaces Pull Requests view. The new options include: 
        - "Opened by Me", to show pull requests that were opened by the user. This filter is available for GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, and GitLab Self-Managed repositories.
        - "At Risk", to show any pull requests that are not drafts and have been open for longer than 7 days. This filter is currently only available for GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, and GitLab Self-Managed repositories.
        - "By repository", to limit the view to a single repo within the Workspace. This filter is currently available for Azure DevOps, GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, Gitlab, and Gitlab Self-Managed repositories.
- For Windows users, GitKraken Client will now respect the `core.longpaths` setting in `.gitconfig`. Previously, GitKraken Client had its own longpaths setting independent of the user‚Äôs `.gitconfig` setting.
    - On Windows, `core.longpaths` now only applies to the files in the working directory, not in the .git directory, to maintain compatibility with Git for Windows.
- GitKraken CLI autocomplete will now be able to suggest more than one argument in these commands: 
    - `git add` 
    - `npm install`
    - `npm remove`
    - `yarn add`
    - `yarn remove`
- Notifications with a Call to Action will now be marked as read when the CTA is clicked.
- Users encountering merge conflicts can now right-click on the conflicts shown in the Commit Panel to reveal new options for easier and faster conflict resolution. The new options available are: 
    - "Take current", which applies the changes from the branch currently checked out to resolve the conflict.
    - "Take incoming", which applies the changes from the incoming branch to resolve the conflict.


### Bug Fixes üêõ

_Bugs‚Ä¶You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy._

- GitKraken Client will now open as expected for users on OpenSSL 3 Linux distributions such as Ubuntu 22.04 and Fedora 36.
- Users will see increased performance when opening a commit diff for very large images. Large images will now display as a binary file Instead of producing an error.
    - For large files, such as images and other media, we recommend using [Git LFS](https://support.gitkraken.com/git-workflows-and-extensions/git-lfs/). 
- Dotted graph lines will no longer take precedence when overlapping with solid lines in graph views.
- Users can now type in the GitKraken Terminal as expected on a wider range of OS versions.
- When un-hiding a remote, users can continue hiding or un-hiding remotes without waiting for the triggered automatic fetch to resolve.
- Azure DevOps integrations and all self hosted integrations will now work properly on our new Teams license tier.
- Users with hundreds or thousands of Azure DevOps Projects will see improved performance when integrating Azure DevOps.
- Users can now use quotation marks when naming Workspaces.
- All Organization and Team actions will remain available after using the login screen.
- The scrollbar in the GitKraken Terminal will now remain clickable in all situations.
- When a user pushes many files up at once to GitHub, they will no longer experience an OAuth infinite loop.
- Opening repositories via `gitkraken --path <path>` when GitKraken is already open will now work as expected.

</div>


_We want to help teams cut out all the jibber-jabber when working with pull requests across multiple repos. Get ready for GirKraken Client v8.4, a release that will have you saying "I love it when a pull request comes together."_

### New ‚ú®
_I pity the tool that does not have Workspaces or the GitKraken CLI._


- GitKraken Workspaces:
    - Workspaces now include a Pull Requests view!
        - Users can filter PRs to see items "Assigned to me".
        - At-risk pull requests are highlighted through a label and filterable.
        - Selecting any GitHub pull request now shows the user a new Pull Request view that presents users options to quickly manage PRs across a whole Workspace.
    - Clicking on any repo in a Workspace now shows see more info and options. Users will see the repository's README, as well as quick access buttons to open the repository in a Repo Tab, Terminal Tab, or on the remote repository's hosting provider.


- GitKraken CLI:
    - The <kbd>Terminal</kbd> button in a Repo Tab‚Äôs toolbar will now open the GitKraken CLI inside a Terminal Panel, instead of opening a new Terminal Tab. Users can still open new Terminal Tabs through a New Tab, the Command Palette, or through any Terminal‚Äôs context menu.
    - Users can toggle the Terminal Panel on and off by pressing the Terminal button in Repo Tab toolbar, through keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ctrl+`</kbd>, the Command Palette, the Terminal Panel‚Äôs context menu, or options in the GitKraken Client's View menu. Toggling the Terminal Panel will turn it on or off across all Repo Tabs.
    - A Terminal Panel session can also be terminated by executing the `exit` command. This will only close the Terminal Panel and not the Repo Tab. Toggling the Terminal Panel back on will initialize a new terminal session. 
    - Unlike with the Terminal Tabs, navigating to a different working directory in a Terminal Panel will not change the repository opened in the Repo Tab.
    - The following `gk` commands are available in the Terminal Panel:
	    - `gk blame`
	    - `gk diff`
	    - `gk history`
	    - `gk help`

### Improvements üôå
_Making GitKraken Client a mean, clean Git managing machine._

- Users will now see helpful icons when shown GitKraken CLI Autocomplete suggestions, helping clarify to which command the suggestion is related.
- Git LFS users will see improved performance checkouts. 

### Bug Fixes üêõ
_Shut up, bugs!_

- Filtering Autocomplete suggestions by name will work as expected.
- After selecting between multiple Autocomplete suggestions that have the same prefix, further suggestions will disappear as expected.
- Users will no longer be allowed to create Workspaces for repositories on unsupported versions of GitLab Self-Managed services.
- Bitbucket Server users will now see the branches correctly populated when creating Pull Requests.

_Get ready for a multiverse bending reveal!  We are unleashing the cosmic power of GitKraken Workspaces with the release of GitKraken Client v8.2!_

### New ‚ú®
_We have helped users progress and seen them accomplish wonders._

#### Introducing GitKraken Workspaces

GitKraken Workspaces save teams time by providing an easy way to group repositories, take actions against multiple repositories at once, and quickly onboard new team members. 

GitKraken Workspaces allow you to gather and access all the required repos for your project in a single tab in GitKraken Client. The new GitKraken Workspaces tab shows you the status for the last branch that you checked out, how far ahead and/or behind in commits you are, and if there is an active WIP for each included repository. 

GitKraken Workspaces can be created as Personal, only visible to you, or Shared, visible to all members of your Organization.  

 - Users can access GitKraken Workspaces from the new ‚ÄúWorkspaces‚Äù tab in the tabs bar, from the New Tab view, from the command palette, which can be opened with the keyboard shortcut <kbd>cmd/ctrl + p</kbd>, or from the newly added repository breadcrumb in any Repo Tab.

- Users can view details and trigger the following actions on any or all of the repositories in a workspace at once:
    - Clone multiple repositories at once. This will help teams quickly onboard a new team member or get a new computer up and running.
    - View the last checked out branch for all repositories and see if a branch is ahead/behind a remote.
    - View work in progress for all repositories, including the number of files modified, added, renamed, or deleted. 
    - Perform a fetch for all or a selection of repositories.
    - Open multiple repos in GitKraken Client, or in an external editor, such as VS Code, IntelliJ, Atom, or Sublime Text.
    - Open any repository in the associated hosting service website.

- GitKraken Workspaces can currently contain repositories hosted on GitHub.com, GitLab.com, or Bitbucket.org.

#### Themes:

- Users may now create their own custom GitKraken Client themes. 
    - For more information about creating a new custom theme, checkout our [Themes documentation](/start-here/themes/) or navigate to `gitkraken/themes/README.md`.

- Users will find two new themes when navigating to <kbd>Preferences</kbd> ‚Üí <kbd>UI Customization</kbd> menu.

- Users can now sync their GitKraken theme with their system theme, if their OS supports it.

#### Activity status:

- An activity status will now display on the avatars of members in your GitKraken Organization or Team, indicating if they are actively using GitKraken Client. This activity status icon is visible in the Team View section in the Left Panel, or in the Organization view in Preferences.

- Users can manually set their status to ‚ÄúActive‚Äù or ‚ÄúAway‚Äù by selecting the circle icon in the top right corner, or by opening the <kbd>Profile/Account</kbd> dropdown menu.

GitKraken Workspaces and Activity status are currently unavailable for Self-Hosted and Stand-Alone customers. 

### Improvements üôå
_When you love something, you improve it._

- GitKraken CLI:
    - Users can now customize the behavior of the <kbd> ‚Üπ Tab</kbd> key when using auto-complete in a Terminal Tab. This setting can be found under <kbd> Preferences </kbd> ‚Üí <kbd>Terminal</kbd>  ‚Üí <kbd> Tab Behavior</kbd>.
    - Users can customize the cursor used in a Terminal Tab. This can be configured in <kbd> Preferences </kbd> ‚Üí <kbd>Terminal</kbd>  ‚Üí <kbd>Cursor Style</kbd>. Users can select either Block, Underline or Bar for their cursor.
    - Auto-complete suggestions will now show branches and tags as options when running `git diff` or `git reset` commands.
    - The `gk diff` command now supports tags and branches as options.
    - Auto-complete suggestions have been added for `npm` and `yarn`.

- When users open the pull request panel and click on a pull request while the left panel is minimized, GitKraken Client will now open the pull request view.

### Bug Fixes üêõ
_We came here years ago to protect users from these bugs._

- When using the GitKraken CLI, suggestions will disappear as expected after auto-completing a command with escaped characters in the path.

- After using GitKraken Client to execute a cherry-pick and resolving any arising conflicts, the Git CLI will no longer report that a cherry-pick is currently active.

- When creating a pull request in a repository with a large number of forks, users will no longer have to wait as all forks are being fetched before opening the dropdown menu.

_"It began with the forging of the Great <del>Rings</del> Kraken."_

The true power of the Fellowship of developer collaboration is unleashed in GitKraken Client's v8.0!
### New ‚ú®

_‚ÄúOne tool to rule them all,_ <br>
_One tool to find them,_ <br>
_One tool to bring them all_ <br>
_and in the Git log bind them.‚Äù_

#### Introducing the GitKraken CLI Preview

The GitKraken CLI adds a Git-enhanced, keyboard-driven, terminal experience to GitKraken Client. Get the powerful Git visualizations GitKraken Client is known for‚Äîlike the commit graph‚Äîin the context of a Terminal Tab. Plus auto-suggest and auto-complete for Git commands to help you drive (and learn) Git faster, with fewer mistakes.

Dive deeper into file changes with the `gk` commands. Use the command `gk history` to see File History and `gk blame` to see what has changed in a file or commit and who made those changes. 

During the GitKraken CLI Preview we are looking for feedback to help improve this feature. Please use the `Feedback` form linked in the bottom right corner of your GitKraken Client app, or email us at feedback@gitkraken.com.


- Users can open Terminal Tabs in a number of ways:
    - Clicking the "New Terminal Tab" button after opening a New tab in GitKraken Client.
    - From the "Terminal" button in the toolbar of a Repo tab (opens the current repo in a Terminal Tab).
    - From the Command Palette (<kbd>Ctrl/Cmd + P</kbd>).
    - When working in a Terminal Tab, you can open a new Terminal Tab with the key combination <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd + T</kbd>. The new Terminal Tab will open in the same working directory. 

- Auto-complete and auto-suggest make building Git commands easier than ever before in the GitKraken CLI. This feature works for users of PowerShell for Windows, ZSH and Bash for Mac/Linux. 
    - Auto-complete and auto-suggest are configured for the most common Git commands, but we are continuing to build out this feature and would love feedback on which commands and parameters you want added. 
    -  Please be aware that other auto-complete programs could potentially cause the GitKraken CLI auto-complete to stop working. You may need to uninstall or disable those other programs to use this feature.
    - Note: If you switch shells, you'll need to set the new shell as default in your operating system settings and restart your computer for auto-complete to continue working as expected.

- Some of the legendary Git visualizations that GitKraken Client is known for are also accessible within Terminal Tabs. To quickly view the commit graph, file diff, history, and blame view, simply type these commands:
    - `gk panel`: toggles the visualization panel on or off. You can also reposition the panel to the top, bottom, left, or right by adding those parameters to the command.  For example `gk panel right` moves the panel to the right of the screen. 
    - `gk graph`: shows the graph view. While this command has similar behavior to `gk panel`, even allowing repositioning of the graph with the same top, bottom, left, or right parameters, this command also returns to the graph if you're in a different view and has subcommands for toggling the graph columns with the keyboard.
    - `gk history` and `gk blame`: open the history or blame panel for a specified file.
    - `gk diff`: shows changes between commits. If no commit SHAs are provided, it will use your WIP and HEAD. If only one commit SHA is provided, it will be compared with HEAD.
    - `gk --help`: shows the list of available `gk` commands. You can also use --help on a specific `gk` command to see its arguments.
    - A toolbar above the panel will display the current repository name, branch, tag, and the number of changes pending to be pulled and/or pushed. Clicking this toolbar will toggle the panel on or off.
    - For Free accounts, this visualization panel will only be accessible within publicly-hosted repositories.

- A Terminal section has been added to the Preferences menu that allows Terminal Tab customization:
    - Font choice. Changes to this setting will only apply to new Terminal Tabs.
    - Font size.
    - Enable auto-complete & auto-suggest.
    - Default the visualization panel position when opening a new panel: top, right, bottom, or left.
    - Show the visualization panel by default. This will apply only when opening new tabs.
    - Terminal theme.

The GitKraken CLI Preview is currently unavailable for Self-Hosted and Stand-Alone customers.

#### Deep Linking

_"Oh, it‚Äôs quite simple. If you are a friend, you speak the password, click the link, and the doors will open."_

We've added the ability to share deep links to specific remote repositories, commits, branches, and tags in GitKraken Client. This allows users to more easily collaborate and save time when working in issue queues or Git pull requests.  

- When shared, these links will both open and focus GitKraken Client to the linked repository. The links will focus GitKraken Client on the commit, branch, or tag specified. When specifying a branch, the latest commit of that branch will be focused.
- The links can be found in GitKraken Client's context menus under `Copy link to remote/commit/branch/tag`.

#### Jira App Integration - Git Integration for Jira
_"It‚Äôs the Jira ticket that‚Äôs never started that takes the longest to finish."_

GitKraken Client now works with the Git Integration for Jira app to allow quick navigation between the client and Jira when viewing commits and file diffs related to Jira issues.

- In GitKraken Client, you‚Äôll find buttons and links to open the following in Git Integration for Jira:
    - File diffs - within the file diff view and in file context menus.
    - Commits - context menu when right-clicking commits in the graph.

- In the Git Integration for Jira, anywhere you view commits and diffs will automatically  have links to open them in GitKraken Client.

- To leverage GitKraken‚Äôs Git Integration for Jira integration you will need to:
    - Connect Jira Cloud Integration in the GitKraken Git Client.
    - Select Jira Cloud as the Issue Tracker for a repository.
    - Select a Jira Project.
    - Install Git Integration for Jira on the same Jira Cloud instance as the Jira Project.
### Improvements üôå
_"Even the smallest update can change the course of history."_

### Bug Fixes üêõ
_"You (bugs) shall not pass!"_

- Styling of long branch names in the right panel has been improved.
- Users will no longer see issues for remotes without access to a repo, as happens when users leave an organization or when forks are deleted.

- The Pull Request icon has been added back to branch labels in the graph.
- The bottom of Diff views are no longer cut off when the file mode changes.
