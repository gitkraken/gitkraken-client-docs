### Improvements üôå
 - Upgraded to Electron 22.
 - Experimental Feature - Git Executable:

_‚ÄúInsights get a solo üéª‚Äù_

### Tuesday, July 11th, 2023

### New ‚ú®
 - GitKraken Insights in Workspaces:
   - GitKraken Insights has been moved from the Pull Request page to its own Insights page.
   - Added a "Last updated date" timestamp.
   - Added a refresh button for an easier time updating Insights metrics.
 - Azure DevOps Workspaces:
  - Users may now create a manually managed Azure DevOps Workspace from a Workspace synced with an Azure Project.

### Improvements üôå
 - Git Executable:
   - The Git Executable feature will now be enabled by default for all GitKraken Client users.
   - Added support for SSH commit signing while using the Git Executable. Commit signing will need to be configured in your gitconfig for now (via `gpg.format`, `user.signingKey`, and `gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile`). Note that actions that do not currently use the Git Executable (like rebasing) will still use GPG for signing.
   - Added support for SSH strict host key checking.
 - Resize commit messages in the Commit Panel to see more (or less) of the message.
  - First select a commit in the graph to access the resize handle for the commit message in the Commit Panel.
 - Improved performance of `View all files` on large repositories.


### Bug Fixes üêõ
 - Pull request panel will once again auto-populate with the commit message when the pull request contains only one commit.
 - When the experimental "Git Executable" feature is enabled, SSH settings for specific integrations will no longer be overridden by the SSH agent.
 - Cloud Workspaces:
   - Fixed Azure DevOps projects not appearing when creating/editing a Cloud Workspace.
   - Fixed `MENTIONED` and `ASSIGNED TO ME` filters on Azure DevOps Cloud Workspaces.
   - Cloud Workspaces that have already been fetched will no longer disappear when there is an interruption fetching Cloud Workspaces (such as losing connection to the Internet).
   - Fixed an issue of `cannot read properties of null (reading 'match')` when using the Git Executable experimental feature.
   - Failure cases in Workspaces have better error messaging to tell the user what is wrong:
     - ...When GitKraken's integration permissions have been revoked externally (e.g. from the GitHub website).
     - ...When a Jira administrator attempts to view the issues of a private project which they do not have permission to view.
 - Fixed an issue where Local Workspaces were not loading.
 - Fixed issues with adding or viewing Workspaces in the breadcrumbs for repos without a remote.
 - Fixed an issue where Jira issue types were not loaded after selecting a Jira project.
 - Fixed an issue where Cherry Picks / Revert completion messages falsely claimed that, "the current branch already has all changes from the commit."
 - Fixed an issue where button labels were missing when signing in with SSO and more than one provider is available.
 - Fixed an issue where many auto-fetches could queue up in the background.

### Improved WSL 2 Support

We‚Äôve heard that WSL is an essential part of many of our users‚Äô development setup, and as WSL's popularity continues to grow, we‚Äôre excited to start offering some improvements for users working in this environment. To give users an opportunity to have a more native-like experience as quickly as possible, we‚Äôve improved the Linux version of GitKraken Client to fix common issues when operating within a WSL 2 environment.

With 9.1, users may now install GitKraken Client in a WSL 2 distribution with WSLg and better work with their Linux repos. For the best experience, we recommend users install GitKraken Client both on their Windows machine as well as their WSLg Linux distro. This allows users to quickly swap between GitKraken Client on each of their operating systems. 

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/wsl-2.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

For more information about WSL 2 / WSLg, and the additional features we‚Äôve introduced to better manage GitKraken Client in this environment, check out the [Help Center documentation](https://help.gitkraken.com/gitkraken-client/windows-subsystem-for-linux/).

### Workspace Improvements

Workspace columns can be sorted on Repositories, Issues, Pull Requests and WIP tables. This should help you better organize your Focus View or Team View. 

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/sort-columns.gif" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

GitKraken Insights is now available for Cloud Workspaces connected to Azure DevOps, which should help Azure DevOps users measure how fast pull requests get merged.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/insights-azure2.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

And all GitKraken Insights metrics now have a dropdown for changing the time period between a 7 day or 14 day time period for licensed users.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/insights-toggle.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

### Quality of Life Boosts

#### Amend Stash Messages

Users may now amend stash messages which should make renaming stashes a breeze. Just right-click a stash in the graph and then click ‚ÄúEdit stash message.‚Äù 

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/amend-stash-graph2.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

You may also right click on a stash in the Left Panel to access the same option.

#### Bypass Git Hooks

Another request from users ‚Äî you may now bypass Git Hooks when committing. To bypass, first stage changes in a repo with Git Hooks enabled and then start typing your commit message. 

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/bypass2.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

You may then click this split button option to commit and bypass the Git Hook.

#### Encoding Support

GitKraken Client 9.1 comes with new encoding support for ISO-8859-1, Windows-1252, and many more. To update the encoding for the app‚Äôs File Diff view, navigate to Preferences > Encoding and set your encoding selection for the repository.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/encoding-preferences2.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

Alternatively, from any file diff in GitKraken Client, click this dropdown menu in the top right to change your encoding preference.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/file-encoding-diff2.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

Of the two options, we recommend users to change the default encoding in their Preferences. That way you‚Äôll be able to read all diffs with the correct characters.

#### Interactive Rebase ‚ÄúDrop‚Äù

And finally, when setting up an Interactive Rebase, you may now set the first commit to `Drop`. 

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/interactive-rebase-drop.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

### Tuesday, December 13th, 2022

_‚ÄúReady to tear into presents? Santa‚Äôs ‚ÄúWorkspace‚Äù has been coding around-the-clock to release these gifts üéÅ‚Äù_

We know how tedious it can be to figure out what repos have recent WIPs and which repos to open next. That's why we're so excited to present GitKraken Client 9.0, and transform your development workflow.

This version helps you create a hub for all your repos and makes working with multiple repos a breeze. Plus, with features like Workspaces and GitKraken Insights, you'll be able to improve your development productivity in no time.

### New 
- Workspaces ‚ú®
  - There are now two types of GitKraken Workspaces: *Local* and *Cloud*.
    - [Local Workspaces](/gitkraken-client/current/#local-workspaces) are a new type of Workspace that reference only repositories on your machine.
        - Select individual repositories, a directory of repositories, or a `VS Code Workspace` (`.code-workspace`) to create a <kbd>Local Workspace</kbd>.
        - <kbd>Local Workspaces</kbd> can also be created from existing `Project Directories` in the <kbd>Repository Management</kbd> view.
        - Quickly open repositories in a <kbd>Repo Tab</kbd>, or in a `VS Code Workspace`.
        - View the currently checked out branch, remote status, and work in progress across all repositories in the Workspace.
        - View repository details, including the README for each repository in the Workspace.
        - Fetch all repositories in a Workspace at once.
  - [Cloud Workspaces](/gitkraken-client/current/#cloud-workspaces) (previously _Personal_ and _Shared_) are enhanced with Pull Requests and Issues from hosting and issue tracking services.
        - <kbd>Cloud Workspaces</kbd> can be easily created from <kbd>Local Workspaces</kbd> from the Workspace menu.
        - The _Overview_ is now out of _Preview_ and has been renamed to the _Focus View_. It displays Pull Requests, Issues, and work in progress that are relevant to you.
        - The _Team Overview_ is now out of _Preview_ and has been renamed to the _Team View_. It displays Pull Requests and Issues for everyone on your team.
        - Tables inside the _Focus View_ and _Team View_ can now be customized to toggle specific columns on/off.
    - Repositories can now be marked as favorites within all Workspaces.

- [GitKraken Insights - Preview](/gitkraken-client/current/#gitkraken-insights) ‚ú®
    - `GitKraken Insights` measures how fast pull requests are merged into your repositories and more! Get metrics like:
        - Average Cycle Time: Measures the average time it takes for a pull request to be merged for the selected timeframe.
        - Average Throughput: Measures the average number of pull requests merged for the selected timeframe. 
        - Merge Rate: The percentage of merged pull requests compared to open pull requests for the selected timeframe. 
        - Open: The total number of pull requests opened for the selected timeframe.
        - Merged:The total number of pull requests merged for the selected timeframe.
    - Note: GitKraken Insights will be gradually rolled out to all users. Look for it soon! 
- [Ghost branches](/gitkraken-client/current/#ghost-branches) üëª
  - A ‚Äúghost‚Äù branch is now displayed when hovering over commits in the graph that shows the closest branch in the <kbd>BRANCH / TAG</kbd> column. This can be toggled on/off in <kbd>Preferences > UI Customization</kbd>.
- [Commit highlighting](/gitkraken-client/current/#commit-highlighting) üí°
  - Now when you hover over a branch/tag, the associated commits will be highlighted on the graph after a brief delay. This can be toggled on/off in <kbd>Preferences > UI Customization</kbd>.
- Solo from the graph üîç
  - You can now solo branches directly from the context menu of branches in the graph, which hides all other branches and commits.


### Improvements üôå

- Workspaces üóÇ
  - The `Create Workspace` form has been refined to include Local and Cloud Workspace types and to make sharing and adding repositories easier.
  - The Workspace loading spinner is less-boring üç≠

  - Color values in default Light themes have been updated to be generally brighter.
  - Color values in the Dark (High Contrast) theme have been updated to better separate content after the UI refresh.
  - Menu bar and context menus will now match the GitKraken Client theme in Windows.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/Local-Workspaces-Example.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

To create a Local Workspace, navigate to the Workspace tab in the upper left of GitKraken Client and click on New Workspace.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/create-local-workspace.gif" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

Select <kbd>Local Workspace</kbd> and then name your Workspace, and browse to select repos to add to your <kbd>Local Workspace</kbd>.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/create-local-workspace-3.png" class="img-responsive center img-bordered">

Once your Local Workspace is created, you‚Äôll see all your repos grouped together and get the following benefits:

- View currently checked out branch for each repo.
- Click on any repo name to open it as a tab in GitKraken Client. 
- Multi-select repos to:
    - Perform a fetch for the selected repos
    - Open repos as tabs in GitKraken Client
    - Use your selection to create a Cloud Workspace (formerly called _Personal_ or _Team Workspace_)

That‚Äôs right! You can also use your Local Workspace to create a Cloud Workspace, which will enable more visibility into your pull requests, issues, and share your Workspace with teams.

#### Cloud Workspaces

Formerly known as _Personal_ and _Shared_ Workspaces, Cloud Workspaces are useful for sharing your Workspace with teams along with enabling GitKraken Insights. 

##### Focus View & Team View

The _Focus View_, which was previously called the _Overview_, is now out of _Preview_ and provides a list of all Pull Requests, Issues, Works in Progress that matter to you.

With this release, you may now toggle columns on or off from this gear in the top left corner.

The _Team Overview_ is also out of _Preview_ and is now called _Team View_. It  will show you all pull requests and issues associated with the repos in your Workspace. 

And similar to the _Focus View_,  you may now toggle columns on or off from this gear in the top left corner. 

### GitKraken Insights

Next, we‚Äôre excited to introduce `GitKraken Insights` ‚Äì which measures how fast pull requests are merged into your repositories.

But why does it matter if you track metrics like pull request Cycle Time and Throughput?

_‚ÄúI think an underlying principle that exists is that the longer your code stays away from being merged, the more complicated your workflow is going to become.And so as those changes land and your PR and your change becomes more behind from the main trunk branch, the more likely it becomes you will have to do more work to get that code working again.‚Äù_
 - Jeff Schinella, Director of Product


To enable `GitKraken Insights`, you‚Äôll first need to open a <kbd>Cloud Workspace</kbd> and then navigate to the Pull Request section. From here, click to connect to your remote hosting service.

Once the connection is complete, return to the Pull Request section in your <kbd>Cloud Workspace</kbd> to view the following metrics for your Workspace pull requests:

- Average Cycle Time: Measures the average time it takes for a pull request to be merged for the selected timeframe.
- Average Throughput: Measures the average number of pull requests merged for the selected timeframe. 
- Merge Rate: The percentage of merged pull requests compared to open pull requests for the selected timeframe. 
- Open: The total number of pull requests opened for the selected timeframe.
- Merged: The total number of pull requests merged for the selected timeframe.


`GitKraken Insights` is currently in _Preview_, and we‚Äôd love to hear your feedback.

### UI/UX Refresh

Next, we recently released the Commit Graph for GitLens where we learned how to improve the graph even more. We‚Äôre delighted to bring those learnings to GitKraken Client 9.0.

##### Ghost Branches

In GitKraken Client, you will now see a ‚ÄúGhost‚Äù branch when you hover over a commit. This will show the closest branch that contains that commit. The ‚ÄúGhost‚Äù branch will also show when a commit is selected, and double-clicking that ghost branch will checkout the head of the referenced branch.

Users may toggle this setting on or off from <kbd>Preferences > UI Customization</kbd>. 

##### Commit highlighting

When you hover over a branch, the app will highlight all commits referenced by that branch.

Users may toggle this setting on or off from <kbd>Preferences > UI Customization</kbd>.
