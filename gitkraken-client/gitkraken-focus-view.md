You have a search bar to filter the results and columns that represent different states of the PRs, Issues, and WIPs, and dropdown selectors for workspace-based filtering.

### Getting started with the Focus View

The Focus View tab can be found in the top-left corner. By default, it displays a list of your Pull Requests, WIPs and Issues directly from your Hosting Service and Issue Tracker, not limiting to a Workspace.

#### Connect Integrations

Integrate your repositories, issues, and pull requests with the Focus View to consolidate your workflow.

You can easily connect your integrations at <kbd>Preferences > Integrations</kbd>

#### Set up Workspaces and Integrations

Create a [Workspace](/gitkraken-client/workspaces/) with the relevant integration. Once created, you will be able to filter and focus on WIPs for specific repositories, issues, and pull requests.

* ALL: Shows all pull requests, issues, and WIPs for the repositories in selected Workspace.
* PRS: Shows all open pull requests for the repositories in selected Workspace.
* ISSUES: Shows all issues for the repositories in selected Workspace.
* WIPS: Shows all uncommitted changes for the repositories in selected Workspace.

You can filter the Pull Requests and Issues by the following:
* Filter PRs by `Mine`, `Created by Me`, `Assigned to Me`, or `Needs my review`.
* Filter ISSUES by `Mine`, `Created by Me`, `Assigned to Me`, or `Mentioned`.

Pull Requests and Issues can be pinned (and unpinned) by selecting the <i class="fa-solid fa-thumbtack"></i> icon to move them to the top of the list. Additionally, you have the option to Snooze PRs either indefinitely or for a specific duration by clicking the <i class="fa-solid fa-snooze"></i> icon, which will relocate them to the 'Snoozed' section. To retrieve these PRs, simply visit the 'Snoozed' section and remove them from the snooze state."
